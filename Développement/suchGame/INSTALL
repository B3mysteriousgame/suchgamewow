INSTALL cpp2dia
==========================================================

1.	untar the downloaded release

		tar xvfz cpp2dia-1.2.0.tgz
   
	this will create a directory "cpp2dia" and extracts the
	files into this directory
   
2.	if you run version 1.2.0 for the first time a config
	file will be created in $HOME/.cpp2diarc
	
3.	set the configuration in $HOME/.cpp2diarc to the values, 
	you like.
	
	THAT'S IT




RUN cpp2dia
==========================================================

cpp2dia reads the content of the current directory and
prints the content of a valid dia (v 0.88.1) file to 
"output.dia" in the current directory

so just change into the directory which contains your cpp
files and execute "cpp2dia.tclsh"
